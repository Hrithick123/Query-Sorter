## 🚀 Project Overview  

The project follows a structured approach with milestones focusing on requirement gathering, design, development, and testing. Key aspects include:  

- **User Stories** – Defined using the SMART principle.  
- **Storyboards & Wireframes** – Designed following Nielsen’s Heuristics.  
- **Project Management** – Tracked using JIRA with task scheduling via Gantt charts.  
- **RESTful API Development** – Documented using OpenAPI specifications.  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** – Implemented using **Pytest**.

## 📌 Milestones  

### **Milestone 1: Requirement Analysis**  
- Identified project requirements.  
- Created **user stories** based on Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary users.  

### **Milestone 2: Storyboards & Wireframes**  
- Designed interactive storyboards to explain project flow.  
- Created high-level wireframes iteratively, ensuring compliance with usability heuristics.  

### **Milestone 3: Project Management & Class Diagram**  
- Managed tasks using **JIRA** and planned project execution with **Gantt charts**.  
- Developed a **Class Diagram** with object relationships using inheritance and composition.  

### **Milestone 4: RESTful API Development**  
- Designed and implemented a **RESTful API** documented in **YAML**.  
- APIs comply with **OpenAPI standards** and can be tested via **SwaggerUI, Insomnia, or Postman**.  

### **Milestone 5: Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
- Implemented **unit tests before writing code** to ensure reliability.  
- Followed a **test-first approach** using **Pytest** to improve code maintainability.
